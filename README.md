# What is a techstack?



_A tech stack is defined as the set of technologies an organization uses
to build a web or mobile application.(Also include the website).
It is a combination of programming languages, frameworks, libraries,
patterns, servers, UI/UX solutions, software, 
and tools used by its developers._



It consists of two elements: the front end and the back end.

The front end is the client-side technology. It’s what users see when they interact with a website. Front-end development focuses on graphics, buttons, and how things behave when someone interacts with them.

Front end vs. back end
If you think of development in more human terms, the front end is like your face and your sense of style. It’s what people see when they look at you, but there’s a lot more to you than what people see.

Front-end tech stacks usually consist of three elements:

HTML – Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is used for structuring and placing content. Think of this as the framework that tells everything where to go.
CSS – Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) determines how the content displays. It controls colors, fonts, layout, etc. Think of this as the paintbrush that tells everything how to look.
JavaScript – Enables interactivity and enhances the functionality of a website or app. This is the part that tells everything what to do.
Front end tech stack
The back end is the server-side technology. It supports the inner workings of a website or app.

If the front end is your face and clothes, the back end is your skeleton, muscles, and organs. These are the behind-the-scenes pieces that make the visible portions look and act the way they do.

The back end consists of a:

Programming languages like JavaScript, PHP, or Python. A programming language is the type of code a developer will use to create your application.
A framework like Ruby on Rails, Django, or Laravel. The framework is a set of components whose purpose is to simplify the development process.
Database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB. This is where your code lives.
A server like Apache, Nginx, or IIS. Your server is a computer program or a physical machine that stores, processes, and delivers (or serves) your coded content to users as a website or application.
Back end tech stack
The difference between web and mobile app tech stacks
To use a mobile app, a user needs to download it to their device. Therefore, companies must develop mobile apps for specific mobile platforms (e.g., Android or iOS).

Mobile app tech stacks use platform-oriented technologies like Kotlin for Android or Swift for iOS.

These technologies run mobile applications on specific platforms. If you want to create an application that works on all devices, you will need to create two versions to work on both Apple and Android.

Android and Apple use different tech stacks
Desktop works differently. Unlike with mobile apps, you don’t need to download a web app to your device to use it.

Web app tech stacks use resources that are available in an internet browser. There are many internet browsers, and your tech stack should work with all of them. However, it’s wise to test your websites and online applications on all the most popular browsers to make sure it works the way you expect.

Why is your tech stack important?
Your tech stack determines what kind of app you’ll be able to build. It also has an impact on what kind of engineers you hire. Developers specialize in specific technologies because there are too many for a single person to learn.

Each tech stack has strengths and weaknesses. For example, some allow for advanced customization. Others are more scalable. Some are better for projects that need a lot of room to grow.

Make sure you talk to your lead engineer about your requirements before picking the technologies you’ll use.

While it’s not impossible to change your stack mid-project, it’s a huge undertaking. That’s why it’s crucial to decide on a tech stack before you start any major work on your app.

What to consider when choosing a tech stack?

Type of project
The type of project you’re working on will often dictate the technologies you need to use.

If you need to build an MVP quickly, for example, you might opt for Ruby or Node.JS. Both of these aid in rapid development.

Project size
The size of your project has a significant impact on which tech stack you should choose.

You can develop most small projects with a simple tech stack.

However, large projects often require complex stacks and more specialized technologies. You may need multiple technologies for different pieces, and your core framework should be able to handle a heavy load.

Cost
Tech stacks have varying costs. Your expenses vary depending on:

Hosting costs
Developer salaries
Technology licensing fees
Maintenance costs
Your budget will often dictate which tech stack you’re able to use.

As a general rule, more advanced and sophisticated tech comes at a higher cost. It also costs more to maintain since you need someone on your staff with specialized expertise.

Companies looking to minimize costs usually opt for open-source technologies.

Time to market
How quickly you plan to launch will also impact your choice of tech stack.

Some tech stacks work on reusable code snippets, which helps reduce development time. Opt for one of these if you’re looking to get an app developed quickly.

MEAN is an excellent example of such a tech stack.

Scalability
When talking about tech stacks, we recognize two types of scalability:

Vertical scalability – How easy it is to add new features to an app using a particular tech stack.
Horizontal scalability – How scalable a tech stack is in terms of accommodating user growth.
Both of these types of scalability are equally important. Any tech stack you choose should satisfy both your vertical and horizontal scalability needs.

Maintenance
Your work isn’t done after you release your app. Ongoing maintenance is an important part of any software project.

Your tech stack will dictate how difficult or costly it’s going to be to perform app maintenance.

In general, apps are easier to maintain when built on tech stacks that allow you to reuse code and scale efficiently.

Security
Some apps require a higher level of security. If you’re building a program that deals with private financial information or medical history, for example, security is more important than something like a simple mobile game.

In some cases, you may need to meet licensing or regulatory requirements.

If security is a priority for your project, opt for using more secure technologies such as Ruby on Rails.

Team expertise
Don’t forget to take into account your team’s expertise when choosing a tech stack.

Your developers need to be skilled at using all the layers of your stack to complete a project. Adopting new technologies is fine, but take into account the learning curve. Is it practical for your developers to learn on the job? Can you afford to have a team with no experts in your tech stack?

As your team grows, your tech stack determines who you should hire. Since more complex tech stacks require more experience and skills, you may have a harder time finding developers.

Popular tech stacks
You don’t have to build from nothing. These popular tech stacks are excellent starting points.

LAMP
LAMP is one of the most popular tech stacks. It’s short for Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP.

Each of LAMP’s layers is open source and free to use.

It’s simple to modify this tech stack to fit your needs. For example, you could use Windows instead of Linux or Python instead of PHP.

MEAN
MEAN is short for MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and NodeJS.

It’s a popular tech stack for teams looking to build an app quickly.

MEAN is an end-to-end JavaScript stack. Because it’s end-to-end, that means you can use a single programming language throughout the entire stack.

In other words, you’re able to reuse code freely across your entire app.

All of MEAN’s layers are entirely free and open-source.

MERN
MERN is a variant of MEAN that uses React instead of Angular.js.

The integration of React gives this tech stack a powerful code library. It also allows for full-stack development.

MEAN is a popular choice for building single-page apps with interactive user interfaces.

Examples of tech stacks
According to StackShare, these are the tech stacks Pinterest, Uber, and Airbnb use.
